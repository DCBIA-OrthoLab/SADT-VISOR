    """Segment teeth and jaw structures on a dental CT or CBCT scan.

    Args:
        scans: One scan (.nii/.nii.gz/.nrrd/.nrrd.gz/.gipl/.gipl.gz), or a
            folder of them for a batch. Folders are searched recursively and
            the output mirrors the input tree, so two patients whose scans
            share a file name stay apart. Files that look like a previous run's
            output are skipped, so a folder can be re-run in place.
        model: The model bundle to use. Its folder name chooses the model and
            with it the label table: DentalSegmentator (adult, five segments),
            PediatricDentalSeg (paediatric, the same five), NasoMaxillaDentSeg
            (six, maxilla split from the upper skull) or UniversalLab (every
            tooth in Universal numbering). Pairing one bundle with another's
            labels is impossible by construction -- the choice is one thing.
        output_dir: Where results are written, one file per scan plus
            `BatchDentalSeg_report.json`. Nothing is written outside it.
        separate_segments: Also write one binary file per label the network
            emitted. Only labels PRESENT in the scan are written: a full
            UniversalLab run would otherwise produce 55 mostly-empty files per
            patient, and an empty mask is indistinguishable from a structure
            the model failed on.
        prediction_ID: Suffix used in output names, e.g. `scan_Seg.nii.gz`.
        device: "cuda" or "cpu". CUDA falls back to CPU when no card is
            visible, with a warning.
        tile_step_size: nnUNet's sliding-window overlap; the window advances by
            patch_size times this. It DOES move the segmentation, so it is left
            at nnUNet's own default.
        gpu_resampling: Resample on the GPU instead of nnUNet's scipy splines.
            Resampling, not the network, is where a run goes: measured per
            bundle on a 512x512x365 CBCT at 0.33 mm, it is 1.5x (Naso), 3.0x
            (DentalSegmentator, Pediatric) and 4.8x (UniversalLab, 279 s down
            to 58 s) end to end. Ignored on CPU and for a bundle whose plans
            pin a non-default resampler.

            It is lossy, which is why it is an argument: the input resampling
            drops from spline order 3 to order 1 (torch has no 3D cubic
            interpolation). Against the scipy pipeline on the same scan the
            worst label of each bundle measured Dice 0.991 (DentalSegmentator,
            Naso), 0.993 (Pediatric) and 0.993 (UniversalLab) -- a sub-voxel
            boundary shift, and better than the 0.978 AMASSS accepted for the
            same change. Set false for bit-identical nnUNet output.

            One caution, and it is about memory rather than accuracy:
            UniversalLab has 55 output classes, and resampling all of them on
            the card takes its peak from 15.5 GiB to 37.1 GiB. On a card
            smaller than about 40 GiB, pass false for THAT bundle. See README,
            "GPU resampling". Recorded in the run report either way.

        export_formats: What comes out. NIFTI is the label volume this tool
            has always written; the rest are surfaces, one file per label the
            network actually emitted, except "VTK (merged)" which is a single
            file holding every surface with a `Label` cell array. Ticking
            several costs one marching-cubes pass, not one per format.

            NIFTI alone by default, which is what every earlier call meant.
            Untick it and no volume is written -- a caller who wants meshes
            only is not made to carry a cohort of label volumes for them.
        surface_decimation: Percentage of triangles dropped from every
            surface, 0 to 99. It applies to the mesh formats and to nothing
            else.

            0, which is parity with the module this replaces: that one
            exports Slicer's closed surface representation, whose
            `Decimation factor` is 0.0, and at 0 the two agree to the byte.
            Measured on one real UniversalLab segmentation at 0.33 mm, label
            8: 11852 triangles and 592684 bytes of STL either way.

            An earlier version defaulted to 90, borrowed from AMASSS without
            being remeasured, and that was wrong here. AMASSS decimates a
            cranial base of 1.6 million triangles, where 90 percent costs
            0.059 mm and stops Slicer freezing on a 41.9 MB archive; a tooth
            is 11852 triangles, three orders of magnitude below the problem
            that rule was written for. It cost a factor of ten in detail for
            a saving nobody needed.

    Returns:
        The output directory, holding the segmentations and the run report. The
        report carries the model's label table -- the segmentation is a volume
        of integers, and without that table they mean nothing.
